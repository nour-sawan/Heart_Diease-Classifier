‚ù§Ô∏è# Heart Disease Classification

This is a heart disease classification project using Python and machine learning.

## üìù Project Description

The project uses a public heart disease dataset to build a binary classification model that predicts whether a patient has heart disease or not.  
It walks through a complete machine learning workflow:

- Data loading and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations (Matplotlib and Seaborn)
- Train/test split  
- Model training using **Random Forest** and **Logistic Regression**  
- **Hyperparameter tuning** using **RandomizedSearchCV**  
- Performance evaluation using **precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix, classification report**  
- Model saving using **Joblib**

This is a-friendly project for anyone learning supervised machine learning in Python.
